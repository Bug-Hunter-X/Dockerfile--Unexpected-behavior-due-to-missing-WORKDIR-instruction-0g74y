This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: the omission of the `WORKDIR` instruction.  The provided `Dockerfile` attempts to copy files and run a Python application, but without specifying the working directory, it may fail unexpectedly. The `Dockerfile_solution` provides a corrected version that includes a `WORKDIR` to fix the issue.  This results in more predictable and reliable Docker image builds.
